Every blockchain has a network of peers. These peers have all the transaction details regarding the currencies that took place before.
-----
Step 1 - Someone requests a transaction
Step 2 - The transaction is broadcasted to Peer (miners) network which consists of computers called as nodes.
Step 3 - The network then validated the transaction and the user using some algorithm designed for the purpose.
         The transactions can involve crytocurrency, data, smart contract, or any information.
Step 4 - Once verified, the transaction are combined with other transaction to create a series of transaction.
         These transactions are called as blocks and series of blocks are blockchain. This chain is unalterable and permanent.
The transaction is then completed.
